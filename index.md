# Ball Tracking Robot
<!-- Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built.

-->

The ball tracking robot uses object tracking to follow the ball. With the use of the Python Library, OpenCV, the camera can recognize faces, detect objects, and much more. This project uses a Raspberry Pi, Pi Camera, Motor Driver to control the motors, DC Motors to control the wheels, and a Ultrasonic Sensor to avoid object collision.

# Third Milestone


<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aX1jdvUm-GE?si=vX5lI-Bp5G8XKcDt" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Summary
For my third milestone, I incorporated the ultrasonic sensor into my project. When the robot gets to a certain distance from an object, it will stop moving until the object moves further away. 

## Challenges
I wanted to utilize the two other ultrasonic sensors in my project, but when I used three ultrasonic sensors, the frames for my PiCamera dropped from 30 fps to around 5 fps. This made it pretty hard for my robot to track the ball, so I only used one. I tried using threading which is running multiple functions or codes at the same time. This method succeeded in keeping the frame rates high, however I realized I will have to cover the right and left ultrasonic sensor for my modification. 

## What's Next?
I plan on adding a way for the robot to take the ball and bring it back to me by using servos to take the ball and implementing PID control.


# Second Milestone

## Summary
My second milestone is to code the ball tracking for my robot. The main components I used for the second milestone is the Raspberry Pi, PiCamera, and the motors. The code I wrote first creates a contour around the ball with x and y as the center of the contour. The x value is the width of the frame. Based on this, if the x value is on the right side of the frame, then the car moves to the right. If the x value is on the left side of the frame, then the car moves left. If the ball is around the middle of the frame, the car moves forward. Lastly, when no contours are detected, the car will turn constantly turn right until it finds anything red.

## Challenges 
A challenge I faced was coding because I didn't really know how to code. So I used many different tutorials to create my ball tracking code. Another challenge I had was when I finished coding the ball tracking, the car would only move left and right to get to the ball, which was fixed when I added a middle range where it could move forward. The last challenge I had was setting up VNC so that I could run the Raspberry Pi without connecting it to my laptop. It only worked once for me, but now it doesn't work anymore.

## What's Next?
For the next milestone I am going to use the ultrasonic sensors to avoid colliding into object. I also might try to set up the VNC again.


# First Milestone

## Summary
My first milestone is wiring up all the components of the robot and making sure that it work. The components I used are the Raspberry Pi, DC motors, a motor driver, ultrasonic sensors, and a PiCamera. The Raspberry Pi controls all the components, the DC motors spin in certain directions, the motor driver amplifies current to the DC motors, the ultrasonic sensors calculates distance, and the PiCamera is a camera. Right now, the motors spin, the PiCamera works fine, and the ultrasonic sensors work. Later on I will write code so that it will track a ball using the PiCamera and if the ball moves, the robot will follow it. I will also use the ultrasonic sensors to avoid crashing into obstacles like the ball. 

## Challenges
One challenge I faced during the first milestone was setting up the Raspberry Pi. I was confused because not only did you have to set up the MicroSD card but you also had to download certain softwares to display the Raspberry Pi on a device. I also had a hard time setting up the SSH for the Raspberry Pi, which is a way to connect the command promt on your computer to the Raspberry Pi terminal. Everytime I tried connecting to the Raspberry Pi through SSH, it would say that it cannot find the Raspberry Pi. 

## What's Next?
For the next milestone, I will code ball tracking, and making sure that the robot follows if the ball moves.


# Starter Project

## Summary
For my starter project, I created the game console. I chose this project because it seemed coolest out of all the starter projects. This game console includes Tetris, Snake, Racing, Space Invaders, and Slots. How this game console works is whenever a button is pressed, it sends a signal to the chip, which is then displayed on the LED dot matrix. The red switch is used to turn on the console, the yellow button is used pause the game, the green button starts the game, and the blue buttons controls the LEDs. 

## Challenges
A challenge when creating this starter project is soldering. I accidentally burnt some parts with the soldering iron, but my game console still works. To avoid this, pay attention to what your soldering iron is touching.

Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
